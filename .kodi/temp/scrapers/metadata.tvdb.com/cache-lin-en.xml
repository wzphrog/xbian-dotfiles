<Overview>In February 2008 a fire destroyed the Cloud Gate Dance Company studio in Taipei. All archives, sets, costumes and rehearsal spaces were lost.

Artistic Director and chief choreographer Lin Hwai-Min took up the challenge and donations from all over the world provided Cloud Gate Dance theatre with new premises and allowed them a new beginning.

This documentary shows the Company in Wuppertal during the preparations of "Wind Shadow" at the Pina Pausch's International Dance Festival. We visit Taipei, Taiwan during the company's 35th anniversary, where we plunge into a world that is strange and mysterious to West Europeans.

In an interview with Lin Hwai-min, we learn more about his work and experience, outstanding pieces like "Wind Shadow", "Moon Water", "Cursive Trilogy" and "Whisper of Flower" will serve as excerpts to show the artistic development of the company within the last ten years.</Overview>
